To optimize your `nx.json` for shared libraries and leverage Nx's tagging and dependency management features, you'll need to implement the following strategies:

1. **Tagging Libraries**: Use tags to categorize your libraries and make it easier to define dependency constraints and optimize your builds.
2. **Leverage Dependency Management**: This helps Nx understand the relationships between projects and optimize builds.
3. **Adjust `nx.json` Configuration**: Modify the existing structure to support shared libraries and enhance dependency management using tags.

Here’s an updated version of your `nx.json` configuration that incorporates tagging and dependency management for shared libraries:

```json
{
  "$schema": "./node_modules/nx/schemas/nx-schema.json",
  "defaultBase": "master",
  "workspaceLayout": {
    "appsDir": "apps",
    "libsDir": "libs"
  },
  "namedInputs": {
    "default": ["{projectRoot}/**/*", "sharedGlobals"],
    "production": [
      "default",
      "!{projectRoot}/.eslintrc.json",
      "!{projectRoot}/eslint.config.cjs",
      "!{projectRoot}/**/?(*.)+(spec|test).[jt]s?(x)?(.snap)",
      "!{projectRoot}/tsconfig.spec.json",
      "!{projectRoot}/jest.config.[jt]s",
      "!{projectRoot}/src/test-setup.[jt]s",
      "!{projectRoot}/test-setup.[jt]s"
    ],
    "sharedGlobals": ["{workspaceRoot}/.github/workflows/ci.yml"]
  },
  "nxCloudId": "6784ea4df996972cd4a976ae",
  "plugins": [
    "@nx/js/typescript",
    "@nx/webpack/plugin",
    "@nx/eslint/plugin",
    "@nx/jest/plugin"
  ],
  "useInferencePlugins": false,
  "useLegacyCache": true,
  "generators": {
    "@nx/react": {
      "library": {
        "unitTestRunner": "jest"
      }
    }
  },
  "projects": {
    "libs": {
      "shared": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib"],
        "projects": [
          "libs/shared/models",
          "libs/shared/utils",
          "libs/shared/expo-ui",
          "libs/shared/web-ui"
        ]
      },
      "core": {
        "tags": ["scope:core", "type:lib"],
        "projects": ["libs/core/auth", "libs/core/services"]
      }
    },
    "apps": {
      "frontend": {
        "tags": ["scope:frontend", "type:app"]
      },
      "backend": {
        "tags": ["scope:backend", "type:app"]
      }
    }
  },
  "dependencyGraph": {
    "projects": {
      "libs/shared/models": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:model"]
      },
      "libs/shared/utils": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:utils"]
      },
      "libs/shared/expo-ui": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:expo-ui"]
      },
      "libs/shared/web-ui": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:web-ui"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Key Changes:

1. **Tagging Projects**:

   - **Libraries (`libs`)**: We have categorized shared libraries under the `"shared"` key, and you can extend this by tagging the libraries based on their scope (`scope:shared`, `type:lib`) and their domain (e.g., `domain:model`, `domain:utils`, etc.).
   - **Applications (`apps`)**: Similarly, applications can be tagged with `scope:frontend`, `scope:backend`, and `type:app`.

2. **Dependency Management**:

   - In the `"projects"` field, I've added the libraries that are shared under the `shared` key.
   - The `"dependencyGraph"` section allows you to list dependencies for shared libraries, which can help Nx understand the relationships and optimize the build graph.

3. **Dependency Constraints**:
   You can add further dependency constraints in your workspace using the `nx.json` file. For example, using tags such as `"scope:shared"` for shared libraries and specifying that apps can only depend on shared libraries. This will allow Nx to better manage which libraries and apps are allowed to depend on others.

4. **Nx Cloud**:
   The `nxCloudId` is included to use Nx Cloud for distributed caching and build analytics. You can adjust the ID as per your needs.

### Additional Optimizations:

- **Fine-grained control over dependencies**: Use tags like `"scope"` and `"type"` to define exactly which projects are allowed to depend on each other, enabling more advanced build optimizations.
- **Shared Dependencies**: To ensure that shared dependencies are used across libraries and apps consistently, you can add them as explicit dependencies in your `package.json` files of the libraries that require them. This helps to reduce version conflicts.

### Benefits:

- **Optimized Builds**: Nx uses the tags and dependency management to optimize the build and test process, running only the necessary tasks.
- **Scalability**: This setup will scale well as your workspace grows. You can easily add new libraries and apps and manage their dependencies.
- **Isolation and Modularity**: By clearly defining dependencies between libraries, it ensures better isolation, reducing the chances of accidental coupling between unrelated parts of your codebase.

### Example of a Tagged Library:

To ensure your libraries are correctly tagged and available across your workspace, make sure that each library, like `libs/shared/models`, has a `tags` section in its `project.json` file:

```json
{
  "name": "libs/shared/models",
  "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:model"],
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      // build configuration
    },
    "test": {
      // test configuration
    }
  }
}
```

By integrating this tagging and dependency management approach into your `nx.json` configuration, you'll gain better control over shared dependencies, ensure consistency across apps and libs, and optimize your build process for large Nx workspaces.

---

The structure you're referring to is a high-level categorization and dependency management configuration for Nx, using a `projects` and `dependencyGraph` structure. It groups your libraries and apps, defines tags for categorization, and establishes the relationship between the projects.

Here’s how it works:

### Comparison:

1. **Tagging and Grouping Projects:**

   - The `tags` field helps categorize libraries and applications by scope and type, and optionally by domain (e.g., `scope:shared`, `type:lib`, `domain:model`).
   - In your `projects` section, you're grouping libraries (like `libs/shared/models`, `libs/shared/utils`, etc.) under the shared category, and similarly for other categories like `core`, `frontend`, and `backend`.

2. **Project Structure:**

   - Each individual library (like `libs/shared/models`, `libs/shared/utils`) gets its own configuration with its specific tags (`scope:shared`, `type:lib`, etc.) within the `dependencyGraph`.
   - The relationship between libraries (e.g., `libs/shared/models` depending on `libs/shared/utils`) is defined under the `dependencyGraph`.

3. **Use of `projects` vs `dependencyGraph`:**
   - **`projects`**: This section defines the logical structure of your workspace. It groups the libraries and applications into categories, like `libs/shared` and `libs/core`, and provides an easy-to-navigate structure to see what apps and libs exist.
   - **`dependencyGraph`**: This is where you explicitly define the dependencies between libraries and apps. If one library depends on another, it should be noted here to ensure Nx understands the relationships and optimizes task execution.

### Key Difference:

- **Direct Configuration in Project JSON (`targets`)**:
  The `project.json` for each library (like `libs/shared/models`) includes its individual `build`, `test`, and other tasks that describe how to run those tasks for that specific library.
- **Group and Dependency Management**:
  The structure you provided in the `projects` section is a higher-level organizational setup, while `dependencyGraph` describes the connections or dependencies between the various libraries and apps.

### Combining Both:

You can merge the concepts. For example, your `libs/shared/models` can have a `tags` section with `"scope:shared"`, `"type:lib"`, and `"domain:model"` for logical categorization. Then in the `dependencyGraph`, you can ensure Nx knows about any cross-library dependencies (like `libs/shared/models` depending on `libs/shared/utils`).

Here’s an example of how you can integrate both configurations:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "libs": {
      "shared": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib"],
        "projects": [
          "libs/shared/models",
          "libs/shared/utils",
          "libs/shared/expo-ui",
          "libs/shared/web-ui"
        ]
      },
      "core": {
        "tags": ["scope:core", "type:lib"],
        "projects": ["libs/core/auth", "libs/core/services"]
      }
    },
    "apps": {
      "frontend": {
        "tags": ["scope:frontend", "type:app"]
      },
      "backend": {
        "tags": ["scope:backend", "type:app"]
      }
    }
  },
  "dependencyGraph": {
    "projects": {
      "libs/shared/models": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:model"],
        "dependencies": ["libs/shared/utils"]
      },
      "libs/shared/utils": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:utils"]
      },
      "libs/shared/expo-ui": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:expo-ui"]
      },
      "libs/shared/web-ui": {
        "tags": ["scope:shared", "type:lib", "domain:web-ui"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Summary:

- **`projects`** section organizes your apps and libs into categories (e.g., `libs/shared`).
- **`dependencyGraph`** describes how these projects are related and includes dependencies, which Nx uses for optimization.
- The `tags` in both `projects` and `dependencyGraph` help you logically group and categorize libraries and apps.

This combined approach leverages Nx’s workspace management to handle tagging, project structure, and dependency relationships efficiently.
