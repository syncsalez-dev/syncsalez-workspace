<!-- ---------------------how to solve dependecies issues with NX-------------------------------------------------- -->

This sequence of steps is a reliable method to resolve many common issues with NX projects. It essentially resets the environment, allowing you to start fresh and resolve potential conflicts or errors.

# Step 1: Remove the node_modules directory

rm -rf node_modules

# Step 2: Remove the .nx folder

rm -rf .nx

# Step 3: Clean the Yarn cache

yarn cache clean

# Step 4: Install @nx/cli globally (if needed)

yarn global add nx

# Step 5: Install project dependencies using Yarn

yarn install

# Step 6: Install nx using Yarn

yarn global add nx@latest -W

# To update yarn in interactive way

yarn upgrade-interactive --latest

---------------- Debug -------------------

If the project graph is still not working after fixing the `nx.json` file, there may be other issues in your workspace setup. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and potentially resolve the problem:

### 1. **Check for Errors in Terminal**

Run the following command with verbose output to get more details about why the project graph is not generating:

```bash
nx graph --verbose
```

This may give you more context about what is failing.

### 2. **Check Node Modules**

There might be issues with the installed dependencies. To fix this, clean your `node_modules` and reinstall the dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json yarn.lock
yarn install
```

### 3. **Update Nx**

Ensure that Nx and all its related plugins are up-to-date. Run the following command to update:

```bash
npx nx migrate latest
```

After running this, review the migration steps, then execute the migrations:

```bash
npx nx migrate --run-migrations
```

### 4. **Validate Project Configurations**

There could be issues in the project configuration files (`workspace.json`, `project.json`). Ensure all projects have the correct format and that there are no missing or misconfigured fields.

### 5. **Check Plugin Installation**

Ensure that all plugins used in `nx.json` are correctly installed. You can do this by running:

```bash
yarn list | grep nx
```

If any plugin is missing, reinstall it:

```bash
yarn add <plugin-name> -D
```

### 6. **Check Permissions**

The error `EPERM: operation not permitted` in your previous logs suggests a possible permission issue. Run your command prompt or terminal as an administrator and try again:

1. Close the terminal.
2. Reopen it as Administrator (right-click -> Run as Administrator).
3. Run `nx graph` again.

### 7. **Review Project Graph Dependencies**

If your workspace includes a large number of dependencies or projects, ensure they are correctly linked and there are no circular dependencies. You can manually review the dependencies in `workspace.json` or `project.json`.

### 8. **Run NX Cache Reset**

Reset the Nx cache, which might help resolve any cache-related issues:

```bash
nx reset
```

### 9. **Manual Debugging**

If none of the above steps resolve the issue, you can manually inspect the graph generation:

1. Run `nx graph` with debug logging:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=* nx graph
   ```
2. Check the logs for any specific error messages or stack traces that indicate the problem.

If after these steps the graph is still not working, you may want to reach out to the Nx community or support forums with the specific error logs for further assistance.
